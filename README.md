## dotfiles

- Neovim config but don't use any plugins.
- i3 vm config.
- awesome vm config but I have changed to use i3 instead of awesome. Because I think i3 is simple than awesome, just my opinion.
- minimal tmux config which can be used in any where else.
- And, hmm, maybe the future I will add to new config

## NOTE: useful-scripts is just a folder can be used by myself, so don't care this folder
